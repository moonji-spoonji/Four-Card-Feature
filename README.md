## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to refine and perfect mobile-first design where it's appropriate and most-effective to implement, and the same for responsive design as a whole. Hopefully after the 21-day course by Kevin Powell I will feel much more confident and can make more beautiful and functional pages! :) <3

Great for learning how to design a page layout.

- [Colt Steele's Free CSS Grid Course](https://www.coltsteele.com/tutorials/mastering-css-grid/css-grid-basics/enabling-css-grid) - This is an amazing free course by Colt Steele I took before starting my journey with Frontend Mentor. I recommend this brief course to everyone looking to better understand how CSS Grid works and how they can implement it practically!
